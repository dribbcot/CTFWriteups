#This box was about exploiting AnyDesk, a remote desktop application, and eventually, setcap, which sets the capabilities of each specified filename to the
capabilities specified#




nmap shows that 22 and 7070 are open
7070 is running anydesk.

If we google for an anydesk exploit, we find https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49613

We can learn more about this from https://devel0pment.de/?p=1881

This takes advantage of a format string vulnerability, which can be used to gain RCE
by sending a single UDP packet to the target machine



As you can see from the .py script, we use port UDP 50001. This is because it is used
to announce anydesk clients within a local network.

Use the msfvenom one liner with your specific IP and listening port to create the shellload payload
The IP variable in the beginning of the script is the target IP

This took me a while to get working and had to reboot the THM machine multiple times

Finally, after I got a shell, got the user flag and found an rsa key in annie's home folder

The RSA key itself needed a password when trying to login, so I used ssh2john to decode it (annie123)

Using this, I was able to ssh in as annie!

Running linpeas, I saw that setcap was something we could potentially exploit so I ran:
setcap cap_dac_override=ep /bin/cat

This allows us to read any file as annie, so I read the /etc/shadow file and got the hash

I used the password to sudo -l as annie, and then sudo -i to become root!
