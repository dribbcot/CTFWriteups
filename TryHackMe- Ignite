I browsed to 10.10.205.142 and found a Fuel CMS getting started page

Scrolling down, you find a login page and some credentials to try out (admin/admin)

This allows us to login to Fuel as admin

Not much here, but we know if we do some research, that the this version if Fuel is dated (version 1.4)

I looked for a Fuel CMS 1.4 RCE exploit and found this to get us a reverse shell:
https://github.com/AssassinUKG/fuleCMS

Very simple to use, just run it with python3, type in 'shell_me' after you spawn the initial session, and you will be able
to catch a shell via netcat

Running linpeas, I saw it was vulnerable to a pkexec exploit, so tried a few different things, but no luck

Running linpeas again, I saw a password 'mememe':
	So I ran: su root
	and entered the password

	And got root!
