This box has us finding and mounting a Backups share and extracting and cracking a user hash to SSH into the machine
with.

From here, we find the mremoteNG connections manager installed on the box. We can easily find the hashes in the appdata/roaming directory
of the local user and use a tool to crack the admin hash. Now, we can simply SSH in as admin to privesc!

Seeing that we have an SMB share port open (445), we can try to login with smbclient
smbclient -L //10.10.10.134 (The -L switch is to list the shares)
Leave password blank

You will see a few shares, one of them being 'Backups'

Use smbclient again to mount this share:
sudo mount -t cifs //10.10.10.134/Backups /mnt/smb
/mnt/smb was a directory that I had made

CD into /mnt/smb
From here, CD into windowsimagebackup/l4mpje-pc/backup

You will see two .vhd(virtual hard drive) files.

The first one is just the boot partition, while the second is the drive

I installed and used guestmount to mount this:
sudo guestmount --add 9b9cfbc4-369e-11e9-a17c-806e6f6e6963.vhd --inspector --ro -v /mnt/vhd

Looking through the drive, we can grab the SAM and SYSTEM files, that contain the hashes, and 
use:
impacket-secretsdump -sam SAM -system SYSTEM local
to dump the hashes

Seeing that the administrator hash starts with aad3 and 31d6, it is safe to assume
that there is no hash, meaning the admin account is probably disabled

Crack the hash for l4mpje and ssh in with the newly discovered password

Here, cd to users/l4mpje/desktop and cat out the user.txt flag

Now, looking at program files and program files (x86), we see mremoteng.
MremoteNG is an open source, multi-protocol, tabed remote connections manager that allows admins to
view all of their connections in a simple interface

We can find the password hashes for this under /users/l4mpje/appdata/roaming/mremoteng/confcons.xml

Use https://github.com/haseebT/mRemoteNG-Decrypt, which can decrypt the remoteNG base64 hash for the administrator

SSH into the machine again as admin with this password, and we can cat out the root.txt flag!
