From here, privesc.

curl linpeas from a spun up http server via python
run it, youl see the user john is in the lxd group

git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder/

this is a script to build alpine linux images 
mark as exectuable and run it to build image

it will build a large alpine.something.something.tar.gz file

use your spun up python server to pull that over to the victim machine
copy and paste this script from https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46978

this will exploit alpine so we can privesc
mark as exectuable

run ./script.sh name.of.large.gz.file
this will give you root privilegees

looking at the script, you can see this gives you root access to /mnt/root
so from here, you can cd to /mnt/root/root
and grab the flag!
